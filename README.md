# Overview

The primary objective of this project is to identify and prevent customer churn within a telecommunications company to enhance business performance.

## Business and Data Understanding

### Stakeholder Audience
The key stakeholders for this project would likely include the management and decision-makers of the telecommunications company. They would be interested in understanding the factors contributing to customer churn and exploring effective strategies to reduce it, ultimately leading to improved revenue and profitability.

### Dataset Choice
The dataset used in this project contains information about 3,333 customers of the telecommunications company, spanning 21 columns. These columns cover various details, including:

- Customer's state
- Account length
- Phone number
- International plan subscription
- Voicemail plan subscription
- Number of voicemail messages
- Day, evening, and night usage details (minutes, calls, charges)
- International usage details (minutes, calls, charges)
- Number of customer service calls
- Churn status (whether the customer has churned or not)

## Modeling

The project uses the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which encompasses several stages:

- Business understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

The modeling phase involved the construction and assessment of various predictive models. The process began with a basic logistic regression model and progressed towards more complex models, such as Decision Trees.

## Conclusion

In summary, our analysis unveils limitations in feature relevance, model selection, potential external influences, and the risk of overfitting. Despite these constraints, we derive actionable recommendations, emphasizing improvements in customer service, engagement with high-usage customers, and the implementation of loyalty incentives to mitigate churn. It's imperative for businesses to recognize and leverage these insights to enhance customer retention and drive profitability.

Additionally, we underscore the importance of addressing states or area codes with high churn rates, as these regions may require tailored strategies for effective churn reduction. Ongoing exploration and validation, potentially involving alternative modeling approaches, remain essential for refining churn reduction strategies.

## Limitations

- **Feature Relevance:** 
  - Not all dataset features were impactful for predicting churn, leading to potential model inefficiencies.
  - Lack of detailed information on states and area codes prevented further in-depth exploration.
  - Addressing regional variations is paramount to crafting effective retention strategies.
- **Modeling:**
  - Model Selection: Despite using Logistic Regression, the focus was on tree-based models. Exploring models like gradient boosting or neural networks might enhance performance.
  - Further research and analysis, considering additional data sources and alternative modeling approaches, are recommended to enhance our understanding and strategy for reducing customer churn effectively.
- **External Factors:**
  - Temporal Changes: The data might exhibit unnoticed trends over time, affecting the analysis.
  - Bias Concerns: Potential biases, such as geographic or demographic, in the dataset could skew results.
- **Generalization:**
  - Overfitting Risk: Models, especially complex ones like Random Forest, might overfit, necessitating robust validation and regularization.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several actionable insights were derived that can help the business reduce customer churn:

- Focus on improving customer service as it's a major determinant of customer satisfaction.
- Engage with customers who have high daily usage, as they are more likely to churn.
- Consider special plans or offers for long-term customers and regions with high churn rates to incentivize loyalty.
